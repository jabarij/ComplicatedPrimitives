# ComplicatedPrimitives

## Description
This library contains types that seem to be primitive but are non-trivial and a bit arduous to implement. This means mainly any abstract algebraic structures (like range) or other .NET primitive types wrappers that modify their behaviour (like CaseInsensitiveString).

## How to install
* Using [NuGet client](docs.microsoft.com/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools) install package [SoterDevelopment.ComplicatedPrimitives](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SoterDevelopment.ComplicatedPrimitives/).
  > Under Visual Studio NuGet Manager Console run command `Install-Package SoterDevelopment.ComplicatedPrimitives` or `Install-Package SoterDevelopment.ComplicatedPrimitives -Version X.Y.Z` to install specific version.
* Downloading any desired version from [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jabarij/ComplicatedPrimitives) or one of available [stable releases](https://github.com/jabarij/ComplicatedPrimitives/releases) and compiling it by yourself.
* Getting it on a 3.5" floppy disk from some suspiciously dressed man on a train station (just kidding, don't do this... in fact it's really hard to read a floppy disk nowadays).

## Compatibility
This library is considered to be compatible with .NET Standard 2.0 to assure the widest reasonable compatibility with .NET Core and .NET Standard projects.

Versioning and releasing instructions are available [here](release.md).

## Documentation
[API documentation](api/index.md) for this project is developed using [XML documentation comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc), so should be available to read directly in your IDE.
